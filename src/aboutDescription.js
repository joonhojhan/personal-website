export default 'Prior to my career in software engineering, I had many experiences in teaching. I taught kids at summer camps topics ranging from English and Math to Engineering and Programming. I attended Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) where I studied Computer Engineering and Math. I attended Fullstack Academy for software engineering and web development where I learned the ins and outs of software engineering, developing full-stack applications, and working in a team. I loved it so much that I applied for and completed the fellowship program at Fullstack Academy. I led teams to completion of projects, led white boarding sessions for algorithms, and realized how much I love software engineering.';
